# Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.  You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web  pages that look the same as the designer file.

## Requirements

- You have to use Bootstrap
- Your `styles.css` must be as small as you can - **you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes**

- Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
- Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
- button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
