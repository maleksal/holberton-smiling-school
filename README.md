# Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.  You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web  pages that look the same as the designer file.
